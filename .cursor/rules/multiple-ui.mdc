UI TO BUILD: $ARGUMENTS
OBJECTIVE
Launch 3 concurrent sub-agents in parallel to develop a single React Native UI concept with different approaches,
Enabling users to compare mobile UI options and select the most effective solution for their React Native app.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH SUB-AGENT

Review the styling specifications in app/design/design-system.json, along with reference mockups for guidance
Construct a React Native component (.tsx file) featuring one interface screen that addresses the user requirements/brief
Use NativeWind/Tailwind CSS classes for styling
Include proper TypeScript interfaces and React Native component structure
Implement mobile-optimized layouts, touch interactions, and responsive design
Save React Native component files to app/components/variations/ using naming convention ui*variation*{n}.tsx (Where n must be distinct such as ui_variation_1.tsx, ui_variation_2.tsx, etc.)

REQUIREMENTS

Each component must be a complete, functional React Native component
Use NativeWind classes for all styling (no inline styles)
Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data
Implement mobile-specific patterns (TouchableOpacity, Pressable, ScrollView, etc.)
Consider safe areas and mobile navigation patterns
Ensure components are reusable and follow React Native best practices
Include proper imports for React Native components and NativeWind
