ANALYZE: the image pasted
OBJECTIVE
Extract a comprehensive design system for React Native with NativeWind/Tailwind CSS, creating reusable design tokens and component specifications optimized for mobile development.
INSTRUCTIONS

Examine the image pasted to identify:
• Color schemes and palettes (for Tailwind config extensions)
• Typography hierarchies (React Native Text styles and font weights)
• Spacing conventions (Tailwind spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, etc.)
• Component patterns (React Native components: View, Text, TouchableOpacity, etc.)
• Interactive elements (button styles, form inputs, list items for mobile)
• Visual effects (borderRadius, shadows, gradients for React Native)
• Mobile-specific patterns (safe areas, gesture handling, responsive layouts)

Generate a design-system.json file that includes:
• Tailwind color palette extensions for React Native
• Typography scale with React Native Text style mappings
• Spacing and sizing tokens using Tailwind conventions
• Component specifications for React Native components
• NativeWind class mappings and utility combinations
• Mobile-optimized interaction states and animations

Save the JSON output to app/design/design-system.json

REQUIREMENTS

Prioritize extracting scalable design tokens optimized for React Native
Structure JSON with clear hierarchy for mobile development
Include complete color systems, typography scales, and dimensional standards for mobile
Record component variations and interaction states specific to touch interfaces
Follow React Native and NativeWind best practices
Omit any literal text, imagery, or data from source screenshots
Create React Native-specific output with NativeWind/Tailwind CSS integration
Include mobile-specific considerations (safe areas, platform differences, accessibility)
